/**
 * <p>New and Improved Stat Bar (Formerly Health Bar). This stat bar can be set to follow
 * an Actor or stay in one place (see constructors). This stat bar may have customized colors,
 * can hipublic int getCurrentValue() {
        return currentValue;
    }de when at full, and can have a customized border. This class aims to be as flexible
 * as possible, allowing it to be simple to use for beginners (easy 0 or 2 parameter constructor)
 * while also highly flexible for those who want to provide more specific parameters (multiple bars
 * in custom colours and sizes with custom offsets and borders).</p>
 * 
 * <p>Instructions:</p>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Choose a constructor. They range from super-simple to ultra-customizable. 
 *  Each one has a set of Parameters for which you must set values. 
 *  These may be integers (like maximum hit points) or Colors. In order to follow another
 *  Actor around, msot constructors require a Target, which can be any Actor. If you don't want
 *  the bar to follow anything, use null for this parameter and the bar will stay wherever you place it</li>
 *  <li>Declare the SuperStatBar in your class variable section. This may be done in your World or in the Actor.</li>
 *  <li>Initialize the statBar.
 *   <ul>
 *    <li>If you're placing the bar inside the Actor, be sure to use <code>this</code></li> for the Target, 
 *       for example:<br><code>statBar = new StatBar (100, player);</code></li>
 *    <li>If you're placing this in the World, then pass it the reference to the Actor, 
 *       for example <br><code>statBar = new StatBar (100, player)</code>;</li>
 *   </ul> 
 *  </li>
 *  <li> </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Implementation - If using multiple bars, all arrays must be the same size. To 
 * optimize the appearance choose a height such that:
 * <p><code> (height - (borderThickness * 2)) % numBars == 0  </code></p>
 * <p>In other words, after factoring out the border, the size should be evenly divisible by 
 * the number of bars, so that all bars end up the same size.</p>
 * <p><b>Version Notes:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Now has a boolean to determine whether it will hide itself when Val is full.</li>
 * <li>Now has a set of constructors to allow simple and complex implementation.</li>
 * <li>2.1.0 --> Added a border feature, allows customization of thickness and colour</li>
 * <li>2.1.2 --> Improved naming of some variables, improved efficiency of update</li>
 * <li>2.2.0 --> Better control of hideAtMax, now with default constant, accessor and mutator</li>
 * </ul>
